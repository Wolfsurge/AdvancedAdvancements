# Advanced Advancements
A mod that improves the visuals of advancements.

This entire mod has been inspired by [Advancement Plaques](https://github.com/AHilyard/AdvancementPlaques), which
hadn't been updated to 1.20.1 at the time of writing this. This does use the textures from Advancement Plaques,
so full credit goes to AHilyard for the creation of them.

This mod utilises [NanoVG](https://github.com/memononen/nanovg) for rendering.

Any pull requests to solve the atrocity that is this code, or just to add some new features, are very, very welcome!
